A simple GATK based pipeline for detection of variant calling, drug resistance profiling and species delineation based on hsp65 sequence.

The script takes in WGS PE data sets and automatically processes them.

The script was developed in 2019 as part of my PhD thesis, independently. Better tools exist now. 

The script uses open source tools such as VelVet, GATK, Picard, BWA, BLASTN and credit goes to their developers for these tools. 

to use, go to Tools folder and run "xz -d blastn.xz"

and run the script in the folder that contains WGS data sets and see the magic!
